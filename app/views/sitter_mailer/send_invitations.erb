I joined SitterScout.com and I wanted to share it with you because it’s
making my life a little bit easier and I think it can help you, too. SitterScout
is a community that enables parents to find reliable babysitters by
connecting with their friends. Joining is easy and free!
All you have to do is create a profile and start connecting with your friends
and babysitters. When you’re ready to book a sitter, SitterScout does all
the work for you so you’ll never have to play phone tag with your
babysitter again.	

Don’t have any sitters? This is where your community of friends comes in
handy! SitterScout connects you with the babysitters that your friends use
and trust, so you can find a babysitter when you need one.	

Join SitterScout.com today and start getting out!
Your friend,
