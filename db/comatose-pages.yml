  body: "What does it cost?\r\n\
    SitterScout is currently a free service and we will be working hard to keep it that way. The larger our community grows, the\r\n\
    better the chance we can remain ad-funded and free to our members. If you like using SitterScout, let your friends and\r\n\
    neighbors know. (link to invite friends)\r\n\
    Do you screen the babysitters on SitterScout?\r\n\
    No. SitterScout is a community where you can meet new babysitters through the friends and neighbors you trust. We\r\n\
    recommend exploring your network of friends to see what sitters they use and who each sitter is connected to. Then ask for\r\n\
    personal referrals from those families who use the sitter. Ask lots of questions about the babysitters your friends are using:\r\n\
    Are they reliable? On time? Trustworthy? Anything else you should know?\r\n\
    We recommend that our babysitters ask questions about the families they will be babysitting for, as well.\r\n\
    Why can\xE2\x80\x99t I find babysitters in my area?\r\n\
    SitterScout is a new, growing community and we may not have a lot of members in your area. We will grow quickly if our\r\n\
    members invite their friends, neighbors and babysitters to join. The more members, the better the odds you\xE2\x80\x99ll be able to find\r\n\
    a babysitter when you need one!\r\n\
    What if I want to keep my connection to a sitter private?\r\n\
    If you\xE2\x80\x99ve got a sitter that you just can\xE2\x80\x99t share, you can check the \xE2\x80\x9CHide Sitter\xE2\x80\x9D next to their name in \xE2\x80\x98Your Sitters\xE2\x80\x99 list on the\r\n\
    dashboard. Once you check this box, your sitter will not appear in your list of Connections."

    reminder to you and your sitter 48 hours before the scheduled job\r\n\
    When you invite new friends to join, you\xE2\x80\x99ll see which sitters they are using and as a result expand your list of available sitters. Unlike\r\n\

    requests to you via text message or e-mail and makes it easy for you to reply. For texting, simply respond with Y for yes\r\n\
