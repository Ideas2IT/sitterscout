======================
 Welcome to Comatose!
======================

From here you'll want to run:

  $ ./script/generate comatose_migration

When that's finished, run:

  $ rake migrate

That's it for the Comatose setup! Now just add the following line to the bottom of your config/routes.rb file:

  map.comatose_admin
  map.comatose_root ''

Be sure to read the README file, and the 'Getting Started' guide. They are located at vendor/plugins/comatose/README and http://comatose.rubyforge.org/getting-started-guide respectively.
