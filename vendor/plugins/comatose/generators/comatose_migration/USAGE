Description:
    The comatose generator creates a migration for the comatose model.
    
    The generator takes a migration name as its argument. The migration 
    name may be given in CamelCase or under_score. 'add_comatose_support'
    is the default.

    The generator creates a migration class in db/migrate prefixed by its
    number in the queue.

Example:
    ./script/generate comatose add_comatose_support

    With 4 existing migrations, this will create an Comatose migration in the
    file db/migrate/005_add_comatose_support.rb
