= Fetcher

Fetcher is a simple message fetcher perfect for using in a daemon.

It implements the following common pattern:

1. Connect to a server
2. Download available messages
3. Send each message to another object for further processing
4. Remove downloaded messages from the remote server

Install using:
script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/slantwise/fetcher/trunk

== Usage

Create a new fetcher object like the following:

  @fetcher = Fetcher.create({:type => :pop,
                             :receiver => IncomingMailHandler,
                             :server => 'mail.example.com',
                             :username => 'jim',
                             :password => 'test'})

The receiver object is expected to have a receive method that takes a message as it's only argument.

Call fetch to run the process.

  @fetcher.fetch

You can also subclass Fetcher::Base or one of the protocol-specific classed to override the standard behavior.
