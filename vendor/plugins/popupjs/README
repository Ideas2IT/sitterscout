Allows you to open up a URL inside of a Facebook-style window. To use
simply assign the class "popup" to a link that contains an href to the
HTML snippet that you would like to load up inside a window:

  <a class="popup" href="window.html">Window</a>

You can also "popup" a specific div by referencing it by ID:

  <a class="popup" href="#my_div">Popup</a>
  <div id="my_div" style="display:none">Hello World!</div>

You will need to install the following hook:

  Event.addBehavior({'a.popup': Popup.TriggerBehavior()});
